                                    <p>If you plan to use insurance, it's helpful to contact your insurance provider before our first session to understand your mental health benefits, including copays, deductibles, and any session limits.</p>

                                    <p>If you feel therapy isn't meeting your needs, I encourage you to discuss your concerns with me directly. Often, addressing these concerns can lead to adjustments in our approach that better align with your goals and preferences.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Therapeutic change isn't always linear or immediately noticeable. Sometimes what feels like a lack of progress is actually an important part of the process. Regular check-ins about your therapy experience help ensure we're on the right track.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>If after discussion we determine that a different therapist or approach might better serve you, I'm happy to provide appropriate referrals. The most important factor is finding the right fit for your needs, even if that means working with another professional.</p>
